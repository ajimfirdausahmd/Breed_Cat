# Cat Breed Classification with Computer Vision and Gen AI (Langflow)

## Project Overview
This project combines Computer Vision and Generative AI to create an application that classifies cat breeds and provides detailed information through a chatbot interface. The system allows users to upload an image of a cat, predicts the breed using a deep learning model, and generates informative responses using a Generative AI chatbot built with Langflow.

## Features

* Cat breed classification using a deep learning model
* Interactive chatbot for breed-specific information
* User-friendly interface for image upload and chatbot interaction
* Real-time feedback and suggestions based on classification results
